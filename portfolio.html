      <i>April 2020</i></br>
      As an Instagram influencer, I'm interested in how I can most effectively grow my account and the number of people I reach. This <b>Python</b> application connects with the <b>Instagram API</b> to generate useful statistics for Instagram influencers.
      It features a <b>Tkinter</b> user interface and dynamic <b>Matplotlib</b> graphs which help users to make well informed decisions when posting.

      I am the manager of 2 Instagram business accounts. One is for my personal photography while the other is dedicated to Colorado 14ers (mountains in Colorado with an elevation of at least 14,000 feet) with over 43k followers.
      Through managing these accounts, I have learned how to have a positive presence on social media as well as negotiate and collaborate with businesses and people.

      My photography has been featured by multiple travel websites and companies including Nikon, Parks Project, and Sawyer Products. My main focus is landscape and adventure photography, however, I do portrait photography as well. In the past couple years, I have done a number of photoshoots for graduating seniors and many Aggies across the university including the Texas A&M Yell Leaders. A link to my professional photography portfolio is below. </p>

      <b>Strava App Project</b></br>
      As an avid runner and triathlete, I am interested in tracking my progess and seeing areas where I can improve in my workouts and races. Using GPS and workout data from an app called Strava,
      I would like to identify how I am improving over time, and compare my performance between multiple efforts on the same course second by second. For a second project, I would also like to use the Strava API to make a personal map of everywhere I have run in the world.

      <p><b>Instagram Web Scraper</b></br>
        My Instagram account (@co14ers) is driven by user submissions which I then curate and repost. When reposting photos, I used to screenshot the original photo on Instagram and crop it on my phone. However, this method is time consuming, leaves room for cropping errors, and 
        potentially lowers the image quality. The better alternative for reposting looks like retrieving the original image from the internet. When the Instagram post is viewed in a web browser, 
        it prevents the user from copying or saving the image directly. However, there is a quick workaround by locating the url of the image in the HTML code and saving it from there. This process, however, though 
        more accurate and high quality, tends to be even more time consuming. I believe that this second method can be automated. My idea is that this web scraper application would automatically 
        download the highest quality version of the photo from a given url of an Instagram post. This would save me a lot of time reposting photos in the future.
