    <div id="words"><p><h2>Midcontinent Independent Systems Operator (MISO)</h2>
      <i>Summer 2022 - Eagan, MN</i></br>
      This past summer, I had the opportunity to be an intern in the Operations Modeling team at MISO. I worked on a number of projects related to improving the model of the electric grid for the Midwest US including
      data validations, a CSV enhancement for Siemens, improvements to a Python application called CLAW, and determining mappings between two databases.
      I started off testing PL/SQL data validations which ensure the quality of the modeling database. I ended up mentoring another intern in the testing process too. 
      My main contribution to MISO was an improvement to an internal Python Application which suggested mappings between 
      two databases. I was able narrow down and improve the quality of suggestions, saving the end user many hours of verifying mappings.

      <i>Summer 2021 - Katy, TX</i></br>
      In Summer 2021, I worked as a software intern at Dimensional Solutions, a company that produces a number of foundation design applications for civil engineers. I gained experience with <b>C#</b> and software development by creating an automated test suite and identifying bugs in the application code. Our team used the <b>Agile Scrum</b> methodology
       and <b>Azure Devops</b> to organize our development process. I also learned a lot about using <b>Visual Studio Code</b> to create pull requests, debug using breakpoints and watchlists, and ultimately navigate and manage code in an organized and efficient manner.

    <p><h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
      <p>When it comes to computer science, one of my biggest interests is <b>data analysis</b>. I am interested collecting, analyzing, and using data to make informed decisions, especially in business. To help accomplish my goals, 
      I am working on a minor in <b>business administration</b> in addition to my computer science BS and MS. I am also doing year-long independent research focused on <b>Machine Learning</b> in which I will grow my data analysis skills and present my thesis to the public in the Spring of 2023.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I want to see people helped through the use of computer science. Whether that's solving the cure to cancer or helping someone make breakfast in the morning, I want to be 
        of service to others. Eventually, I would like to go do mission work overseas and use computer science to help people around the world who don't have access to the same basic resources, luxuries, and education that I 
        have been blessed to experience growing up in America.
